# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This is a work day scheduler, which:
- lists time-blocks from 9-5 that are editable 
- allows the user to save their inputed tasks 
- displays the time-block hours by color corresponding to the time left to complete said task
(past hours are in white, present hours are in red, and future hours are in green).
